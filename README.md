# Rentably

## Why Rentably?

Dealing with rents can become very tiresome when you have a lot of them to handle. We tried to think in a simple software solution to help dealing with these problems.

## What is Rentably?

Rentably is a web plataform created to help Joana keep track of it's many rents. It comes with a built-in e-mail notification system that will keep you updated with your concerns as a landlord/landlady.
